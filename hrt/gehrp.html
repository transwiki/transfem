    <h2>introduction</h2>
    <p>
        In season 2 episode 13 of <i>House M.D.</i>, a 15-year-old female fashion model collapses on stage and is eventually diagnosed with paraneoplastic syndrome secondary to an unknown cancer. However, the team is unable to actually find a tumor until House orders an MRI of her groin after piecing together a few anomalies from her medical history, like that she had never menstruated. Surprisingly, she is found to have testicular cancer and XY sex chromosomes. Now, this is <i>House M.D.</i> of course, the same show in which a comatose man is temporarily revived with an unproven injection of stimulants, taken to eat a sandwich, and then convinced to donate his heart to his dying son by committing suicide, but the intersex condition depicted in this episode does actually exist.
