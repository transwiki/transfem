    <h2>introduction</h2>
    <p class="a">
        In season 2 episode 13 of <i>House M.D.</i>, a 15-year-old female fashion model collapses on stage. She is eventually diagnosed with paraneoplastic syndrome secondary to an unknown cancer, but the team is unable to find a tumor until House pieces together a few anomalies from her medical history, like that she had never menstruated, and orders an MRI scan of her groin. Surprisingly, despite appearing to have normal female genitals and unambiguously feminine secondary sexual characteristics (breasts, wide hips, etc), she is found to have testicular cancer (on hidden, undescended testicles) and XY sex chromosomes<a href="https://house.fandom.com/wiki/Skin_Deep"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.

    <p class="a">
        Now, an obvious question: does this condition actually exist?
    </p>
    <p class="a">
        How could it be possible for a girl or woman to live her entire life without anyone noticing that on such a fundamental level, she is "actually male"? Remember, this is <i>House</i>, the same show in which a comatose man is temporarily revived with an ad hoc injection of stimulants, taken to eat his favorite sandwich, and then convinced to donate his heart to his dying son by committing suicide with aspirin. Who knows what kind of medical nonsense the writers could be capable of inventing. We're taught in school that DNA is the "blueprint of life", written over millions of years by random mutations and fine-tuned by the invisible force of natural selection, containing all the instructions for how to make all the proteins that keep us alive. And that in this simple, romantic picture, males have XY sex chromosomes, and females have XX sex chromosomes.

    <p class="a">
        But it does exist (it's called androgen insensitivity syndrome).
    </p>
    <p class="a">
        For the intents and purposes of the average person's everyday life, the simplified picture is close enough. Most people have never knowingly met or made friends with an intersex or trans person; to them, those exceptions to the rule may as well not exist. But we do exist, now more visibly than ever before, and the legislation these people vote for affects us greatly. The political culture war over gay marriage was decisively won in the United States in 2015, being made legal in all 50 states following the Supreme Court ruling in <i>Obergefell v. Hodges</i><a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2014/14-556"><sup>[x]</sup></a>. In 2021, transgender rights have taken its place as the next set of political culture war topics. And in this context, the simplified picture is no longer sufficient. The existence of androgen insensitivity syndrome and other related conditions challenges the understanding of biology held by the general public and forces us to confront uncomfortable realities lurking in the cracks of such approximations.

        So what is actually happening here, biologically speaking? [how possible? explain by examples: androgen insensitivity syndrome, XX male syndrome]

        [summary, flawed understandings of biology in the general public, inaccuracy of "biologically male/female" in misgendering trans people]
