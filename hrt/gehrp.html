    <h2>introduction</h2>
    <p class="a">
        In season 2 episode 13 of <i>House M.D.</i>, a 15-year-old female fashion model collapses on stage. She is eventually diagnosed with paraneoplastic syndrome secondary to an unknown cancer, but the team is unable to actually find a tumor until House pieces together a few anomalies from her medical history, like that she had never menstruated. Surprisingly, despite appearing to have normal female genitals and unambiuously feminine secondary sexual characteristics (breasts, wide hips, etc), she is found to have testicular cancer (on hidden, undescended testicles) and XY sex chromosomes. Well OK, you might think, but this is <i>House</i>, the same show in which a comatose man is temporarily revived with an unproven injection of stimulants, taken to eat his favorite sandwich, and then convinced to donate his heart to his dying son by committing suicide with aspirin. How could it be possible for a woman to live her entire life without anyone noticing that on such a fundamental level, she is "actually male"? Aren't we taught that DNA is supposed to be the "blueprint of life", the greatest recipe book ever, written over millions of years by random mutations and fine-tuned by the invisible force of natural selection, containing all the instructions for how to make all the proteins that ultimately determine who we are? There was a time when it looked like it was going to be that simple and romantic. But as usual in science, upon further analysis, the situation has turned out to be far more complicated. It is indeed possible for a woman to unknowingly have XY chromosomes, and while certainly rare, it does happen.
