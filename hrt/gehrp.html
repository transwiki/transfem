    <h2>introduction</h2>
    <p class="a">
        In season 2 episode 13 of <i>House M.D.</i>, a 15-year-old female fashion model collapses on stage. She is eventually diagnosed with paraneoplastic syndrome secondary to an unknown cancer, but the team is unable to find a tumor until House pieces together a few anomalies from her medical history, like that she had never menstruated, and orders an MRI scan of her groin. Surprisingly, despite appearing to have normal female genitals and unambiguously feminine secondary sexual characteristics (breasts, wide hips, etc), she is found to have testicular cancer (on hidden, undescended testicles) and XY sex chromosomes<a href="https://house.fandom.com/wiki/Skin_Deep"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.

        Now, an obvious question: does this condition actually exist?
    </p>
    <p class="a">
        We're taught that DNA is the "blueprint of life", written over millions of years by random mutations and fine-tuned by the invisible force of natural selection, containing all the instructions for how to make all the proteins that keep us alive. And that in this romantic picture, females have XX sex chromosomes, and males have XY sex chromosomes. How could it be possible for a girl or woman to live her entire life without anyone noticing that on such a fundamental level, she is "actually male"? And after all, this is <i>House</i>, the same show in which a comatose man is temporarily revived with an improvised cocktail of stimulants, taken to eat his favorite sandwich, and then convinced to donate his heart to his dying son by overdosing on aspirin<a href="https://house.fandom.com/wiki/Son_of_Coma_Guy"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. Who knows what kind of medical nonsense the writers could be capable of inventing?
    </p>
    <p class="a">
        But the fashion model's condition does exist; it's called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_androgen_insensitivity_syndrome"><sup>[3]</sup></a>.
    </p>
    <p class="a">
        For the intents and purposes of the average person's everyday life, the rigid categories of XX and XY are close enough. Most people have never knowingly met or made friends with an intersex or trans person; to them, those exceptions to the rule may as well not exist. But we do exist, now more visibly than ever before, and the legislation these people vote for affects us greatly. The political culture war over gay marriage was decisively settled in the United States in 2015, being made legal in all 50 states following the Supreme Court ruling in <i>Obergefell v. Hodges</i><a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2014/14-556"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. In 2021, transgender rights have in many ways taken its place as the next set of political culture war topics, and in this context, the rigid categories start to break down. The existence of androgen insensitivity syndromes and other related conditions challenge the understanding of biology held by the general public and force us to confront the uncomfortable realities that get smoothed over by such approximations.

        So what is actually happening here, biologically speaking? [how possible? explain by examples: androgen insensitivity syndrome, XX male syndrome]
